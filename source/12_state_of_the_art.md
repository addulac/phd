## Context of the Study

The study of complex networks is grounded by the graph theory and more specifically the random graph theory [@albert2002statistical][@Newman03]. The latter approach is particularly well adapted for complex networks because, by definition, their associated graphs haven't a *rigid* topological structure such as being acyclic, complete, or specific symmetries in the connectivity patterns, or at least, we don't know these properties a priori.
Instead, there is a level of uncertainty in the topological structure and in the law that control the dynamics of a complex network.
This uncertainty makes the problem of finding a good model to explain the construction of a given network (and make prediction on it) ill-defined.
Besides, there is an other source of uncertainty that comes from the fact that there is no strong consensus about the semantics behind the construction of the network; what does it means that there exists a connection between two nodes in a network? Why and when a connection is established between two nodes? There is no obvious answer to those questions, and worse, the answer may not be the same depending on the type of the network considered (\ref{sec:network_type}). Even for two networks with similar type, the answer may differ for two different couple of nodes. For example, the notion of friendship in a social network can vary according to the country or the culture considered. Or, for a hyperlink network, such as the Web^[The World Wide Web], a web page could points to another because the content is related in some way, or maybe because it references a sponsor, which are two completely different reasons.
Hence, to face this uncertainty we focus our study on probabilistic models as they provide a natural framework to build powerful and flexible model in this context [@ghahramani15_nature].
