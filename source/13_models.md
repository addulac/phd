# Latent Variable Models
\label{sec:model}

## Preliminaries

baysesian networks
distribution
(nature)

### Exponential familly


### Concluding remarks
Importance of the distribution according that the results of the thesis are often connected in the end to the properties of the exponential familly distribution.

### Nonparametric Process

(do I nedd levy process here ?)

#### DP and HDP

#### IBP

#### Concluding remarks

echangeability
gaussian process...




## Random Graph Models
\label{sec:network_model}

### Representation Theorem

+ Latent Variables; echangeability etc

[airoldy thesis; orbanz; ]

+ echangeable Models
[@goldenberg2010survey]


Point to MMSB and IBP in later presentation.
